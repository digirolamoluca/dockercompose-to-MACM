# dockercompose-to-MACM
With this project it's possible to transform whichever docker-compose into a cypher language. This is done with a python script (generator_cypher.py) with support of macm.py and networkx.py (python libraries). It's possible to get the MACM by entering the cypher query in Neo4j.
It's important compile configuration file (config.py) so that python script works
