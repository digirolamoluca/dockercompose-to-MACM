# dockercompose-to-MACM
With this project it's possible to transform a docker-compose (which respects the syntax as defined in the case study) into a cypher language. This is done with a python script (final_generator_cypher.py) with support of macm.py (python library). It's possible to get the MACM by entering the cypher query in Neo4j
